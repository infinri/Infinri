                <h3 class="faq-question">What counts as a "small request" in the monthly plan?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Things like fixing a broken button, updating text, swapping an image, or adjusting colors. 
                    If it takes me less than 30 minutes and doesn't require new pages, it's probably a small request.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Do you work with WordPress/Shopify/other platforms?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Yes! I work with most platforms including WordPress, Shopify, Magento, and custom sites. 
                    If it runs on the web, I can probably help fix it.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What if I need more than 5 requests in a month?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    No problem! Extra requests are just $15 each - still way cheaper than hourly rates. 
                    I'll let you know before doing any extra work.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can I cancel the monthly plan anytime?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    Absolutely. No contracts, no cancellation fees. Just send me an email and 
                    you're done. You'll still get support through the end of your current month.

                <h3 class="faq-question">What if my project takes longer than expected?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">
                    For monthly plan requests, there's no time tracking - I'll finish the job properly regardless. 
                    For larger projects, I'll always let you know if something will take longer and why.

                <p class="faq-answer">
                    I'll always let you know if I'm going on vacation or unavailable. For monthly plan 
                    clients, urgent issues get priority and I'll extend your plan if needed.
