            <h2>2. Deposits & Initial Payments</h2>
            <p>Depending on the project size:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some website builds may require a 30–50% deposit</li>
                <li>Deposits are non-refundable once work has begun</li>
                <li>Deposits secure your place in our schedule</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>"Work begins"</strong> is defined as when we start deliverable work on your project, including but not limited to design, development, file preparation, content implementation, server setup, or configuration.</p>
            <p><em>Initial consultation, quotes, and requirement discussions do not constitute "work beginning."</em></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Website Packages ($10 / $25 / $50)</h2>
