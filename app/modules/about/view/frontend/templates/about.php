                <p class="about-description">
                    I started Infinri because I got tired of seeing small business owners struggle with 
                    websites that don't work right. You shouldn't need a computer science degree to 
                    get your site fixed, and you definitely shouldn't have to pay agency prices for 
                    simple problems.

                    You work directly with me, not a sales team. That means better prices

                    I'm not looking for one-off projects. I want to be your go-to developer
